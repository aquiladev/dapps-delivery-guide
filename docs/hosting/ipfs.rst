`InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System>`_ is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.

IPFS allows users to not only receive but host content, in a similar manner to BitTorrent. As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. Any user in the network can serve a file by its content address, and other peers in the network can find and request that content from any node who has it using a distributed hash table (DHT).

Upload to IPFS
--------------

There is a `GitHub Action <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-to-ipfs>`_ which allows to upload a DApp to IPFS on Marketplace.

In order to use it, you need to add step to `main.yml`::

    - uses: aquiladev/ipfs-action@v0.1.1
      id: upload
      with:
        path: ./build

There will be a build artifact on a runner after `steps <github-actions.html#basic-pipeline-for-a-dapp>`_ (usually in directory `build` or `dist`). You need to pass the directory as a `path` parameter.

The step will have `hash` output â€” it is needed for later use. Token `${{ steps.upload.outputs.hash }}` can be used in next steps where `upload` is the id of current step.
