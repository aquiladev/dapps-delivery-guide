`Unstoppable Domains <https://unstoppabledomains.com>`_ launching domain names on blockchain technology. The domain names can be used for both payments and websites. A domain name canâ€™t be taken down by the players that typically participating in the domain name system. Hence, the name Unstoppable Domains. Another value is that It can replace your cryptocurrency addresses with one single human-readable name.

Unstoppable Domains provides `.crypto` (aka CNS) domain names for the entire crypto community.

The `GitHub Action <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/update-ddns>`_ allows updating `.crypto` name during pipeline execution.

Setup pipeline with .CRYPTO update
==================================

Requirements
************

1. Before setting up a pipeline the CNS name should be configured, it should have a resolver. Take a look on prev section

2. `Basic pipeline <github-actions#basic-pipeline-for-a-dapp>`_ should be configured with `step which provides IPFS hash <ipfs>`_

Pipeline step
*************
Open and add the step to `main.yml`::

    - uses: aquiladev/ddns-action@v0.1.1
      with:
        mnemonic: ${{ secrets.MNEMONIC }}
        rpc: ${{ secrets.RPC }}
        name: ddns-action.crypto
        contentHash: ${{ steps.upload.outputs.hash }}

Parameters
**********

- `${{ secrets.MNEMONIC }}` is a secret. The mnemonic phrase is needed for wallet recovery of an account which owns CNS name. It can be a private key of the account as well
- `${{ secrets.RPC }}` is a secret. RPC is a URL of Ethereum Mainnet node
- `ddns-action.crypto` - CNS name which you want to update
- `${{ steps.upload.outputs.hash }}` is content hash. It came from `upload to IPFS step <ipfs>`_

Secrets
*******
In order to manage sercerts in a repository you need to open Settings -> Secrets

Pipeline
********
Eventually pipeline should look like::

    name: CI
    on:
      push:
        branches:
        - master

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '10.x'

      - run: npm ci

      - run: npm run build

      - name: Upload to IPFS
        uses: aquiladev/ipfs-action@v0.1.2-alpha
        id: upload
        with:
          path: ./build

      - name: Update CNS
        uses: aquiladev/ddns-action@v0.1.1
        with:
          mnemonic: ${{ secrets.MNEMONIC }}
          rpc: ${{ secrets.RPC }}
          name: ddns-action.crypto
          contentHash: ${{ steps.upload.outputs.hash }}

Run pipeline
************
The pipeline will run immediately after commit (if you committed to master branch)
